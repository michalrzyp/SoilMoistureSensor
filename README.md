# SoilMoistureSensor
The assumption of the project was to create a soil moisture sensor and a station collecting measurement results, 
which by analyzing the received data provides information on the degree of soil moisture. 
The sensor placed in the pot sends information via radio to the base station, which is located anywhere in the apartment / house. 
The sensor measured humidity by measuring its resistance.
